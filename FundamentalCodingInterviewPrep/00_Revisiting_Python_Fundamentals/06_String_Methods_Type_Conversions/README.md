# Unit 1: Revisiting Python Essentials - Lesson 6: Mastering Python String Methods and Type Conversions

You've been journeying through Python like a starship captain! ðŸš€ Keep going, your skills are expanding to new galaxies with each lesson!

## Lesson Overview
Greetings! In today's lesson, we'll explore Python's string methods: `split()`, `join()`, `strip()`, and learn how to perform type conversions. Python's robust built-in string methods simplify text processing, enhancing the readability and efficiency of our code.

## Understanding Python's 'split()' Function
Constructing strings frequently entails dividing them into smaller sections or 'tokens'. The `split()` function in Python achieves this goal by breaking a string into a list of substrings using a specified delimiter. If no delimiter is provided, it splits the string by a single whitespace character.

```Python
sentence = 'Python is fun!'
words = sentence.split() # no delimiter provided, splitting by whitespace
print(words)  # Output: ['Python', 'is', 'fun!']
```
In the example above, we observe that `split()` divides sentence into words. We can also opt for different delimiters, such as a comma.

```Python
data = 'John,Doe,35,Engineer'
info = data.split(',') # provided a ',' delimiter
print(info)  # Output: ['John', 'Doe', '35', 'Engineer']
```

## Exploring the 'join()' Method
Conversely, Python's `join()` method concatenates, or 'joins', strings into a single string:

```Python
words = ['Programming', 'with', 'Python', 'is', 'exciting!']
sentence = ' '.join(words)
print(sentence)  # Output: 'Programming with Python is exciting!'
```
Here, `join()` takes a list of words, which are strings, and merges them into a sentence â€” a single string, using a space as a delimiter.

## Mastering the 'strip()' Method
Discerning extra spaces in strings can prove challenging, and they may lead to problems. Python's `strip()` method removes leading and trailing spaces, tab or newline characters from a string:

```Python
name = '    John Doe    \t\n'
name = name.strip()
print(name)  # Output: 'John Doe'
```

Furthermore, we can use `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` to remove spaces, tabs, and newline characters from the left and right of a string, respectively:

```Python
name = '    John Doe    '
print(name.lstrip())  # Output: 'John Doe    '
print(name.rstrip())  # Output: '    John Doe'
```

## Python Type Conversions
Python's built-in type conversion functions, such as `int()`, `str()`, `float()`, and `bool()`, enable the switching between different data types:

```Python
num_str = '123'
print(type(num_str)) # Output: <class 'str'>
num = int(num_str)
print(type(num)) # Output: <class 'int'>
```
We can also employ `str()` to convert a number to a string, which proves handy for concatenating a string with a number:

```Python
name = 'John'
age = 25
print('My name is ' + name + ', and I am ' + str(age) + ' years old.')
# Prints: My name is John, and I am 25 years old.
```
## Combining split(), join(), strip(), and Type Conversions Together
In specific scenarios, we need to combine all these methods. One such scenario could be the task of calculating the average of a string of numbers separated by commas:

```Python
numbers = '1,2,3,4,5'
# Convert string to a list of numbers
num_list = [int(number) for number in numbers.split(',')]
print(num_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Calculate average
average = sum(num_list) / len(num_list)
print('The average is', average)  # Output: The average is 3.0
```
By integrating these methods, we can transform the string `'1,2,3,4,5'` into a list of numbers, calculate their average, and display the result.

## Quick Recap and Next Steps
Well done! A quick recap: Python's `split()`, `join()`, `strip()`, and type conversion methods are fundamental functionalities in Python programming. Now, practice these concepts in the subsequent exercises. Happy programming!
