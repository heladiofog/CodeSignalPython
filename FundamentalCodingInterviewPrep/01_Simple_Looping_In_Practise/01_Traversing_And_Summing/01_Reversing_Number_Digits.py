# Your task is to construct a function that accepts an integer `n` and returns the integer with the same digits as `n`, but in reverse order. You should implement your solution using a `while` loop.

# For instance, if the input is `12345`, the output should be `54321``.

# Keep in mind that `n` will always be a positive integer between 1 and 10^8.

# Do not use built-in functions that convert the integer to another data type, such as a `string`, to reverse it. Solve the problem purely using mathematical operations and loop constructs.

# Note that when the result has leading zeros, you should consider only the integer value (e.g., 1230 becomes 321 after the operation).
