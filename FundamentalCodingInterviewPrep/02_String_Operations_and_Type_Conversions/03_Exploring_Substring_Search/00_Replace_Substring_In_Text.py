# Imagine you are working on a new feature for a text processing application. The feature requires you to provide users with the option to replace all occurrences of a certain substring in the entered text with a new substring.

# You are tasked with writing a function, replace_substring(text: str, old: str, new: str) -> str, that does the following:

# Accepts as input text (a string of length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, which includes only lowercase alphabets and spaces), old (a string of length k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, which includes only lowercase alphabets), and new (a string of length m, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 500, which includes only lowercase alphabets).

# Replaces every occurrence of the string old in text with the string new.

# Returns the updated text string with all replaced substrings.

# Please ensure that the case of the letters remains consistent during the process, meaning an uppercase letter should be replaced with an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter should be replaced with a lowercase one.

# For instance, your function might be called as follows:

# Python
# Copy to clipboard
# replace_substring("hello world", "world", "friend")
# In this case, the output would be:

# Copy to clipboard
# "hello friend"
# This is because there is one occurrence of the substring 'world' in the string. This occurrence is replaced by 'friend', resulting in the return value "hello friend".

def replace_substring(text, old, new):
  # TODO: Implement the function
  pass

# Solution:
def replace_substring(text, old, new):
  # TODO: Implement the function
  # old_words = text.split()
  # new_words = []
  # resulting_text = ''
  
  # for word in old_words:
  #     if word == old:
  #         new_words.append(new)
  #         continue
  #     new_words.append(word)
  
  # resulting_text = ' '.join(new_words)
  # print(f"resulting text is {resulting_text}")
  
  print(f"resulting text is {text.replace(old, new)}")
  return text.replace(old, new)
  pass
