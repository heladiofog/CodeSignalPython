# You are given two lists of integers (listA and listB), each containing n elements, with n ranging from 1 to 50. Each element in both lists can range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive.

# Your task is to write a Python function that identifies pairs of integers {a, b} wherein a belongs to listA and b belongs to listB, and a is greater than b. The function should return all such pairs in the order in which a appears in listA.

# For instance, if listA consists of [5, 1, 8, -2, 0] and listB comprises [3, 2, 7, 10, -1], the output should be [(5, 3), (5, 2), (5, -1), (1, -1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 7), (8, -1), (0, -1)].

# Importantly, the order of elements in the output tuples should reflect the sequence in which a appears in listA. A pair cannot be included more than once. If no pair meets the condition, the function should return an empty list.

# Hint: Solving this task requires the use of nested loops. The outer loop should iterate through listA and the inner loop through listB, checking the condition a > b during each iteration.

def solution(listA, listB):
  # TODO: Find the pairs of integers a, b where a belongs to listA and b belongs to listB such that a is greater than b
  pass

# Solution:
def solution(listA, listB):
  # TODO: Find the pairs of integers a, b where a belongs to listA and b belongs to listB such that a is greater than b, a tuple can not be repeated
  resulting_tuples = []
  for a in listA:
    for b in listB:
      if a > b and (a, b) not in resulting_tuples:
        resulting_tuples.append((a, b))

  # print(f"Resulting tuples: {resulting_tuples}")
  return resulting_tuples
  pass
